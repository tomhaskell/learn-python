# Learn Python

Play repo for learning Python. Intended to be a quick reference as I go through the Codecademy
[Python for Programmers](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-for-programmers) course.

- [Python Basics](main.py)
- [Strings](strings.py)
- [Classes](classes.py)
- [Lists](lists.py)
- [Tuples](tuples.py)
- [Dictionaries](dictionaries.py)
- [Sets](sets.py)

## Dev containers

This project also uses Dev Containers, which allow you to develop inside an isolated docker
container, linked directly to VSCode so you don't have to install all the deps on your base system,
or deal with version conflicts. For Python, you could just use venv, but this approach is language-
agnostic.

There's a great primer on how to set up Dev Containers with VSCode and Python here:

- [Pt1: Setup](https://andypickup.com/developing-in-python-with-dev-containers-part-1-setup-f1aeb89cbfed)
- [Pt2: Dependency install](https://andypickup.com/developing-in-python-with-dev-containers-part-2-a-simple-fastapi-project-with-step-debugging-e52599b7ce61) - you can ignore the fastapi stuff

I've mostly added it to this repo as a reference for future projects.
